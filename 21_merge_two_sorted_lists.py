# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
# EASY
# https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/

# You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
# Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
# Return the head of the merged linked list. 

# Example 1:
# Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
# Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

# Example 2:
# Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
# Output: []

# Example 3:
# Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
# Output: [0] 

# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
